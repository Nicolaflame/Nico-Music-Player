# Nico-Music-Player

This is a project created by following along with Modern Web's youtube tutorial, 'How to create Music player with pure HTML, CSS, JS.'

still need to complete the tutorial, but ran out of time today. Ended at: 29:41 in video.

Player is working but I have an error:
"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML')
at app.js:41:29"
